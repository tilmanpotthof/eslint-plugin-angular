# directive-name

All your directives should have a name starting with the parameter you can define in your config object.
The second parameter can be a Regexp wrapped in quotes.
You can not prefix your directives by "ng" (reserved keyword for AngularJS directives) ("directive-name":  [2, "ng"]) [Y073](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y073), [Y126](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y126)
