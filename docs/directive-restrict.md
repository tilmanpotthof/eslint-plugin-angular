# directive-restrict

Not all directive restrictions may be desirable.
Also it might be desirable to define default restrictions, or explicitly not.
The default configuration limits the restrictions `AE` [Y074](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y074) and disallows explicitly specifying a default.
